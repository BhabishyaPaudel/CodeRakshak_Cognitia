MyNITM: Our Digital Solutions is a Java Swing-based desktop application, developed during the Cognitia Hackathon 2024, 
that addresses key challenges faced by students in managing fee receipts and handling lost-and-found items within educational institutions.
Responding to the hackathon's Problem Statement 3, this application leverages SQL on the backend to provide a secure and efficient solution.

Key Features:

Fee Receipt Management: The app enables students to digitally store and manage fee receipts, reducing the dependency on physical copies and minimizing the risk of lost or
misplaced pay cheques or cash receipts. This feature simplifies the documentation process, ensuring that payment records are easily accessible and securely stored.

Lost-and-Found Management: The app includes a streamlined reporting system for lost-and-found items. Unlike traditional email communications, 
which can be time-consuming and difficult to track, this system allows students and administrators to report, categorize, and track items efficiently within the app.

Enhanced Data Validation: To improve reliability, the app integrates data validation protocols that ensure records are accurate, 
reducing the chances of errors in fee management and lost-and-found tracking.

Future Enhancements: Planned upgrades include push notifications for real-time updates, 
integration with broader school management systems, AI-driven chatbots for on-demand support,
and scalability through modern technologies and AI.

This digital solution effectively addresses the need for a dedicated platform to manage institutional workflows,
empowering students and administrators with a reliable and accessible system.
